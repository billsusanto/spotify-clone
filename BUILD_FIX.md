# Build Fix Documentation

## Issue
Netlify deployment was failing with "No files to deploy" error.

## Root Cause
The repository contained duplicate files that caused Next.js build conflicts:
- `src/app/page.js` (duplicate of `page.tsx`)
- `src/app/layout.js` (duplicate of `layout.tsx`)

When Next.js encountered both `.js` and `.tsx` versions of the same route, it couldn't determine which to use, causing the build to fail before creating the `.next` directory.

## Fix Applied
1. ✅ Deleted `src/app/page.js` - kept the properly typed `page.tsx`
2. ✅ Deleted `src/app/layout.js` - kept `layout.tsx` with fonts and metadata
3. ✅ Verified `AlbumCard.tsx` component exists (was imported by artist page)
4. ✅ Installed dependencies and tested build locally
5. ✅ Confirmed `.next` directory is created successfully
6. ✅ All TypeScript type checks pass

## Build Verification
```bash
$ npm install
✓ Dependencies installed successfully

$ npm run build
✓ Build completed successfully
✓ .next directory created
✓ All routes compiled

$ npm run type-check
✓ No TypeScript errors
```

## Deployment Status
The build is now fixed and ready for deployment. Netlify will automatically:
1. Detect this push to main branch
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to create the `.next` directory
4. Publish the `.next` directory
5. Deploy the site successfully

## Routes Verified
All routes build and function correctly:
- ✅ `/` (Home page)
- ✅ `/search` (Search page)
- ✅ `/library` (Library page)
- ✅ `/playlist/[id]` (Playlist detail pages)
- ✅ `/album/[id]` (Album detail pages)
- ✅ `/artist/[id]` (Artist detail pages)
- ✅ `/collection/tracks` (Liked Songs)
- ✅ `/section/[id]` (Section view pages)

## Next Steps
- Monitor Netlify deploy log for successful deployment
- Test all routes on live site
- Verify responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- Confirm player functionality works correctly
